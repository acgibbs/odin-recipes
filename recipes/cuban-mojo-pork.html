        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This Mojo Pork is marinated with the best citrus and garlic Mojo Criollo and slow cooked until fork-tender. The perfect crock pot dump-and-go Cuban pork recipe!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (4-pounds) pork shoulder or pork butt</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>3/4 cup orange juice, freshly squeezed</li>
            <li>1/2 cup lime juice, freshly squeezed</li>
            <li>Zest of 1 orange</li>
            <li>Zest of 1 lime</li>
            <li>1/2 cup olive oil</li>
            <li>8 cloves garlic, chopped finely</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped cilantro (lightly packed)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
           <li>Using a paring knife, make a few slits all over the surface of the pork.</li>
           <li>Place the pork roast in the slow cooker and add the rest of the ingredients. Make sure the pork gets coated with the marinade.</li> 
           <li>Cover and cook on high for 5 - 6 hours or on low for 8 or until tender.</li>
           <li>At this point, the pork is fully cooked and can be served with the cooking juices or you can make a quick sauce</li>
           <li>To crisp up the top, carefully remove the pork from the slow cooker and place it onto an aluminum foil lined baking sheet. Bake on a preheated 400 degrees F oven for about 15 to 20 minutes or until nicely browned. </li>
           <li>Remove from the oven and let it rest for 10 minutes before serving. You will be able to shred the meat with a couple of forks. Yes, it will be that tender!</li>
           <li>Serve with the remaining juices from the slow cooker or sauce.</li>
        </ol>
